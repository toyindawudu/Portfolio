                <h2>What do you do?</h2>
                <p>I am a self-taught Developer and a Photographer based in London, United Kingdom. I'm currently working on freelance projects for small business and startup businesses. Iâ€™m passionate about technology,creative projects and working with data (analysis and delivering actionable insight). However, at the moment, I enjoy making and developing highly responsive products for the web and mobile displays using a variety of technologies.</p>
                <h2>What else do you get up too?</h2>
                <p>In my spare time, I enjoy learning to speak other languages. I can communicate (speak,read and write) Spanish. Currently trying to add French, Arabic and Japanese to my repetoir over the next ten years.</p>
                <h2>How can we collaborate or work together?</h2>
                <p>That's easy! Simply send me an email and let's start a conversation.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="column-2">
                <h2>And Photography, that's an odd, why?</h2>
                <p>Not, really! Photography allows me to be creative and social yet offering value with my creative skills. While writing code and building whether websites or google chrome extensions, this primarily allows me to do what comes natural.</p>
                <h2>What kind of projects do you enjoy building?</h2>
                <p>At this precise moment in my journey, I'm enjoying building businesses that fundamentally solves a problem. So for example, I built a website for my Wife that showcases here skills and talents as a Theatre Maker.</p>
